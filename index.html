			<h2 class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-5'>Hello, my name is Jeremy Henry and I am a social science teacher</h2>
			<p class='col-md-7 col-md-offset-5'>My story to teaching in the secondary environment begins when I entered the private sector soon after completing my undergraduate education at San Diego State University. As a young adult, teaching was not a career that I envisioned, yet I was soon dissatisfied with the lack of positive social impact that my new career held. Reflecting, I believed that I had much to offer in terms of understanding and investigaing the world around us. Thus, I set my sites on an advanced degree at Johns Hopkins University to build not only my knowledge base, but also my skills as a student. The social sciences and humanities consumed me and I without hesitation I resolved to attain a teaching credential at the secondary level--a place where ideas, interests, and passions for fields of study truly begin.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class='jumbotron sectionThree'>
		<div class='container'>
			<h1>Philosophy-</h1>
			<p class='col-md-12'>I have dedicated a significant amount of my life to studying philosophy, politics, economics, and history, because I am passionate about these fields of study. As an instructor of the social sciences and humanities, my aim is to bring this passion and enthusiasm into every class. I strongly believe that if I am engaged in the value of the content, students will not only become motivated and more receptive to my classes, but with hope, they will begin personal journeys of historiographic reflection, objective interpretation, and critical inquiry. To accomplish this, I endeavor to present all content in such a way that it is student-focused and persuasively constructed, so that they awaken to the pedagogical principle that we learn not for school, but for life--Non Scholae Sed Vitae Discimus—and thus, the content becomes actually worth knowing. My goal is to inspire students to come to class because they are excited about what they are going to learn next, with the understanding that these fields of study shape our way of life—past, present, and future.</p>
			<p class='col-md-12'>Reflecting on my most memorable learning experiences, regardless of age, course, or academic setting, the most effective teachers not only offered up new information, but presented innovative and often ignored perspectives and accounts of information as well. Thus, I adopted the strategy audi alteram partem or “hear the other side” which was the same strategy that my most influential teachers employed in their classrooms. “Hear the other side” represents an integral practice that I implement each day—during each class—offering unheard and fresh perspectives, all-the-while delivering relevant and integral content in such a way that it is memorable, not memorized. My courses are designed so that students are genuinely challenged and inspired by the tasks and activities, and more importantly, designed so that students feel enabled and supported to participate with voice.</p>
			<p class='col-md-12'>However, realizing that providing facts and information is only a fraction of what teaching really is, I also employ the pedagogical practice of critical listening; drawing out a diversity of student insights and experiences to create an environment where we all become learners simply by listing as a community. To facilitate critical listening, I strive to provide essential details prompted by content specific questions, allowing students to practice self-discovery by creating their own conclusions and interpretations. This strategy teaches students to discern tertiary awareness from an informed and thoughtful understanding; my role therefore is to guide students on how to explore claims and structures of reasoning in such a way that they can build conceptual knowledge and social awareness. I find that this strategy is beneficial for the students because it is based upon recognizing the value of multiple perspectives, not simply their own. By the end of my courses I not only desire for students to have a strong understanding and appreciation for the humanities and social sciences, but also thoughtful and well-conceived opinions, justifications, and awareness.</p>
			<p class='col-md-12'>Because our students come from all walks of life and must balance varied learning environments, I understand that it is important to set ground rules and explain my expectations of the students up front. I make it clear to my students from the beginning that my classrooms are a place where everyone is welcome, everyone is encouraged, and that in my room we practice mutual respect. Additionally, I disclose that my role is indeed to teach the social sciences and humanities, but also to teach young students to be empowered self-motivated and directed individuals. This framework is integral because it constructs a safe atmosphere for all learners, and yet guides students to take responsibility for their learning; ultimately this strategy prepares students for all futures that may lie ahead, and emphasizes that independent decisions will direct the outcome of education.</p>
			<p class='col-md-12'>Perhaps just as important as the teaching methods, is the caring aspect of teaching. I have found that students must see that you care about them and their learning, or they won’t care about the content, course, or leaning environment. I feel that the best way to accomplish this feat is to try to get each student actively engaged in every lecture, debate, and activity. Students are encouraged to leave behind the passive student role, and adopt an active accountable student role—one that I facilitate through equitable practices and strategies. This allows me to establish my credibility as both a capable and caring teacher, thus creating a community of animated, respectful, and enthusiastic learners. And if successful, this strategy fosters productive, attentive, and conscientious student-teacher relationships and peer-peer relationships as well.</p>
			<p class='col-md-12'>Lastly, it is important for me to recognize that my work as a teacher will never be finished or perfected; the skill of teaching is one that is constantly evolving and adapting and I must continually strive to improve my own performance. I understand well that teachers are still learners, and that all learners are simply at varying stages. I therefore strive to adapt to the perspective of the student, and reflect on what the student experience represents, which is an individual phenomenon. Furthermore, teachers must lead by example and demonstrate collaboration, listening, patience, and the constructive application of knowledge. Therefore I work to establish a positive yet professional tone in the classroom every day, recognizing that my students are an extension of myself and that they are our future professionals and educators.</p>
